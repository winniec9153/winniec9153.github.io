          <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>After completing the GitHub unit in our SEP 10 course, we were tasked with applying our knowledge to a major project—the Choose Your Own Adventure Project. This interactive story allows players to make decisions that shape the outcome of the game. To develop it, we had to utilize GitHub skills such as linking files and using the command line. The project required group collaboration, with each team assigned a specific theme. My partner and I were given the topic of creating a love story. While we had plenty of creative freedom in crafting the narrative, we also had to meet specific GitHub-related requirements to successfully complete the project. </p>
          <h2> Content</h2>
            <p>Me and my partner got choosen the topic Adult hood as that was one of the choices we put for te toic we wanted to do. We made a story using git command and you get to choose and decide the choices you want to make. We were required to create our project using the GitHub skills and command line knowledge we had learned. Before we could begin, we had to develop a detailed plan, which accounted for 20% of our grade. This plan outlined the folders, text files, and brief descriptions of their contents and how they would connect. We created this layout using Google Drawings, which also helped us assign tasks and determine how each folder would be linked. Once we had a clear structure, we moved on to creating the mandatory files, which were crucial to the project and made up 30% of our grade. Without these files, we wouldn’t have been able to properly link the folders together.
</p> 
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>I didn’t face many challenges while working on this project with my partner since I have a good understanding of GitHub, which made the technical aspects easier. However, one challenge I did encounter was during the planning phase, where I had to come up with ideas and smoothly transition between different choices in the story. Ensuring that everything connected properly required a lot of creativity. At times, it took me a few minutes to think of the right wording or path to make the story flow naturally. Despite this, I was able to overcome these challenges by taking my time and carefully considering the best way to structure each choice. To overcome the challenge of creating smooth transitions, I could start by planning with a flowchart to visualize the connections between choices. Brainstorming multiple options for each transition would help me pick the best one. Reading aloud can also highlight awkward parts, and looking for inspiration from similar stories might spark new ideas. Seeking feedback from others can provide helpful suggestions, and if I get stuck, taking breaks can help clear my mind. Instead of aiming for perfection right away, I could focus on writing first and editing later. Practicing creative writing can also improve my ability to create smoother transitions.
</p>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Some takeaways I got from this project was to plan things out and try brainstorming multiple ideas so I will know what the best option is. Smooth transitions in an interactive story require careful thought and structure, but taking the time to brainstorm, seek feedback, and use tools like flowcharts can make the process easier. It's essential to stay patient and allow space for creativity to flow, even when it takes a few tries to get things right. By focusing on the writing first and refining later, I can improve both the technical and creative aspects of the project. This experience has taught me that tackling challenges with a mix of organization, experimentation, and patience leads to better results.</p>
            <h2>Next Step</h2>
            <p>The next step I plan to take is to dedicate more time to brainstorming. This will help me ensure that my ideas make sense and flow well. To improve my project further, I also plan to ask for feedback from my partner or others, as getting outside perspectives can help refine the story and identify areas for improvement.</p>
