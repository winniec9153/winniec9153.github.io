            <h1 class="margin text-center">SEP10 Freedom Project</h1>
            <p>I am a student at HSTAT in the Software Engineering Program. The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing through using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Github, and I also chose to independently study Animate.CSS in order to help me make my website better.</p>
            <p>For my project, I chose the topic of Music Production because I am curious by how all these great music I listen to get created. In this freedom project we have to create an innovation in which I made a possible innovation called the Mood Adapt Music Player which is a cool device which can give you a personalized music recomendation based on your current mood and speech. So in order to create this website I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I kept all my notes of my progress of studying this tool in my learning log.</p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p> Some challenges I faced when creating this website were trying to make my website responsive. This was a problem as every time I made my screen size smaller in inspect mode to check out the responsiveness, my image size didn't change as it stayed big. Another challenge I had was trying to make my website stand out as I am not that much of a creative person.
.</p>
            <h2> Takeaways</h2>
            <p> Some takeaways I have are adding comments and labels in your code so you can organize it better. By doing this, it makes everything so much easierâ€”for example, if you have tons of cards and you get confused about which card is for what part in that section, you can add these labels so you know what each card is for. This allows you to find what you want fast, and it's more efficient when you're coding. Another takeaway is to add a good amount of media queries to make your website very responsive. With the help of media queries, I am able to make my images smaller when the width of the screen size decreases.</p>
